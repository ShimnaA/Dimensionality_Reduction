***Dimensionality Reduction***

***Principal Component Analysis***

    - Dataset -> Wine datset from UCI

    - Clustering done - 3 customer segments idetified
    - Logistic Regression model to predict which customer segment it belongs
    - Component axes that maximize variance
    
    - PCA means Creating 2 new extracted features based on the existing feature
    - Accuracy of 97.2%
    
    - By using dimensionality reduction, can improve the final result.
    
***Linear Discriminant Analysis***

    - Dataset - Same as above
    - Supervised algorithm 
    - Maximizing the component axes for Class Separation
    
    - Linear Discriminant Analysis done 
    - Apply Logistic Regression model on the reduced dataset 
    - and got an Accuracy of 100%

***Kernel PCA***

    - Dataset - Same as above
        
    - Kernel PCA used for dimensionality reduction
    - Apply Logistic Regression Model on the reduced dataset
    - Accuracy of 100%
